# -PyBer_Analysis

1. Overview:
2. The new analysis was made to delineate prices, consumers, and pyber drivers by 3 regions, suburban, urban, and rural. The new analysis gives us an easier way to see the data first hand.
Results:
All the associated graphs can be found in the repository. We can see a clear disctintion in market share for our 3 disctinct city types. First of all demand in Urban cities far exceed both suburban and rural cities. The demand for rides in Urban areas are two times as much as suburban and rural makes a very small number of rides in the totality of Pyber's clientele. Saying that the numbers of drivers-consumers directly impacts the pricing of the given areas. Having a lower amount of drivers in rural areas drastically impacts the price of the ride as compared to urban areas where there is a large supply of drivers. Of course suburban is in between the extremes of Urban and Suburban.


Summary: 
The disparities in prices can be directly accosiated with relationship between total labor available vs given need for Pyber's services. It seems because there is such a low supply of drivers in rural areas prices far exceed that of the other areas and vice versa. Saying that it necessary to point out that most of our market share is tied to higher populated areas (urban, suburban). The last thing to point out is that we should pay our drivers more or less depending on the area as it might balance out the amount of drivers given each areas needs.
